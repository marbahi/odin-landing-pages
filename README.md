# Landing Page Project

This project is a simple **landing page** built using **HTML** and **CSS**, inspired by the full design and style guide provided. It is part of a hands-on exercise to improve web layout skills, especially using **flexbox**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The page consists of 4 main sections and a footer:

1. **Hero Section** – Contains the main headline text (hero text) that appears at the top of the page.
2. **Features Section** – Highlights some key offerings or features.
3. **Quote/Testimonial Section** – Displays a quote or user feedback.
4. **Call to Action Section** – Encourages user interaction.
5. **Footer** – Contains bottom-level navigation or text.

The goal is to recreate the given design image (Image One) and apply the correct color and font style from the style guide (Image Two).

## 💡 Development Approach

* The layout is built **section by section** to avoid feeling overwhelmed.
* All content is added first using **HTML**, followed by styling with **CSS**.
* Only **one CSS file** is used for this project.
* Flexbox is heavily utilized to arrange and align elements on the page.
* No responsive/mobile styling is implemented in this version.
